# Spring Boot Demo Project

This simple project accesses the dealership database.  The pom.xml file was generated by the Spring Initializr at https://start.spring.io.

With just a few annotations, we can select records from the database using:
   - Spring Boot with dependency injection and IoC container
   - Spring CrudRepository
   - Java Persistence API
   - Hibernate
   - MySQL driver
   - MySQL database server 8.4.0
